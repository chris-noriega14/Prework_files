1. The 5 items on the list of Boo's favorite things needed to use the list tag in order to have the items set up correctly <li></li>
2. The wikipedia url for Boo The Dog was not set up between the quotation marks after the href function. The original link just refreshed the page.
3. The About Boo section had one big paragraph instead of four different sections.
   I updated the html to split the About Boo paragraph into four different sections using the <p> and </p> paragraph tags.
4. The header title of "Boo The Dog Fan Page!" needed to be encapsulated by the <h1> header tag.
   This allowed the html to correctly use the appropriate font-family, text color, and text size from the already existing style.css code.
5. The image of Boo the dog wasn't displaying properly because angle brackets were missing before the img tag and after the src url.
6. I deleted the instructions for the exercise in the Boo the dog website by removing the five classes associated with that section as well as the text.
7. The button ids for the text colors were originally set up to the wrong color so that was updated.
8. The color pink was typed in parenthesis when setting up the button functionality in the logic.js file.
9. The boxGrow and boxShrink javascript functions didn't put the click between double quotes in the logic.js file.
10.The javascript source for the html was incorrect; the source was updated to logic.js.
11.The different facts about Boo incorrectly added a double quote in the beginning of the list and at the end of the list.
   I updated the booFacts variable in logic.js by adding double quotes to every single fact.
12.I adjusted the order of the 4 bottom sections in the webpage in order to match the Grumpy Cat example.
13.I removed a </div> tab in order to have more margins on the bottom 4 sections of the webpage.
